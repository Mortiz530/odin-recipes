  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to 
    be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be 
    devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one 
    below is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to 
    experiment.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tortilla:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade soft flour tortillas.</li>
    <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Brush the tortillas with olive oil before you season them. </li>
    <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> These tortilla pizzas are seasoned with garlic powder, black pepper, and dried oregano. </li>
    <li><strong>Tomato Sauce:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade tomato sauce. </li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Top the tortilla pizzas with sliced chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions. Of course, you can customize the toppings to suit your taste. </li>
    <li><strong>Cheese: </strong> Finish the pizzas with mozzarella cheese. </li>
  </ul>
